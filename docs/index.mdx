Pikku - meaning tiny 🔎 in Finnish - is a minimalistic batteries included framework built around simple functions. It works with any event driven design (currently **http**, **websockets**, **mcp**, **queues** and **scheduled tasks**) and can be run on any Javascript runtime, currently Cloudflare Workers, Fastify, Bun, AWS Lambda, Express, uWS, WS and others.

## Quick Start

```bash npm2yarn
npm create pikku@latest
```

* **Deploy Anywhere** 🌍 - Run your functions anywhere, as long as it's event based. Currently supporting HTTP, WebSockets and Scheduled Tasks with more coming soon.
* **Batteries Included** 🔋 - Services, session management, auth, docs, it's all here..
