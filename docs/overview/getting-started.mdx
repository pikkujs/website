# First steps

In this set of articles, you'll learn the **core fundamentals** of Vramework. To get familiar with the how Vramework works, and we'll build a basic CRUD application with features that cover a lot of ground at an introductory level.

#### Prerequisites

Please make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 20) is installed on your operating system.

For the duration of this guide, will be using `yarn` to install and manage our packages.

We will also be relying on workspaces. This isn't a requirement, but provides alot of flexibility and help with how we structure our codebase. You can read about it [here](./why-workspaces) 

#### Setup

We first need to install the starter project using **Git**:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vramework/vramework-starter.git project
$ cd project
$ npm install
```

The `project-name` directory will be created, node modules and a few other boilerplate files will be installed, and a few different folders will be created.

```
src/
    main.ts
    config.ts
    services.ts
    services/
      email-service.ts
    functions/
      email-functions.ts
      email-functions.spec.ts
```

Here's a brief overview of those core files:

|                          |                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.ts`      | The entry point                                          |
| `config.ts` | The config to be use by the server                                                                               |
| `services.ts`          | A function that creates all the expected services required                                                                          |
| `services/kysely.ts`         | Our database driver                                                         |
| `services/email-service.ts`         | A simple email service.                                                                               |
| `functions/hello-world.ts`                | A hello world function |
| `functions/email-function.ts`                | Functions related to emails |
| `functions/email-function.spec.ts`                | The unit tests for the controller |

The `main.ts` includes an async function, which will start our application.

```typescript
import { VrameworkExpress } from '@vramework/vramework-express'
import { config } from './config'
import { setupServices } from './services'
import { getRoutes } from './routes'

async function main(): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const services = await setupServices(config)
    const routes = getRoutes()
    const appServer = new VrameworkExpress(config, services, routes as any)
    appServer.init().then(async () => await appServer.start())
    process.removeAllListeners('SIGINT').on('SIGINT', async () => {
      services.logger.info('stopping server')
      await appServer.stop()
      process.exit(0)
    })
  } catch (e: any) {
    console.error(e.toString())
    process.exit(1)
  }
}

main()
```

#### Running the application

Once the installation process is complete, you can run the following command at your OS command prompt to start the application listening for inbound HTTP requests:

To run the server, run:

```bash
$ cd server
$ yarn start
```

This command starts the app with the HTTP server listening on the port defined in the `src/config.ts` file. Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. You should see the `Hello World!` message.

To watch for changes in your files, you can run the following command to start the application:

```bash
$ yarn start:dev
```

This command will watch your files, automatically recompiling and reloading the server.
