Cloudflare Functions is a serverless compute platform by Cloudflare, designed for low-latency execution at the edge.

Pikku integrates with Cloudflare Functions using the Node.js runtime via the `@pikku/cloudflare` package. It supports WebSockets, HTTP, and scheduled tasks.

There are multiple ways to deploy a function on Cloudflare. If you prefer an infrastructure-as-code approach, [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) is the recommended tool. 

This guide assumes you are using Wrangler for deployment, as it provides a seamless development experience, but the core principles apply regardless of method.

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup

To create a new Pikku project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm create pikku@latest
```

### 2. Run Locally

Start a local development server:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run start
```

This compiles the `hello-world` example and runs a local server:

```bash
[wrangler:inf] Ready on http://localhost:8787
```

To verify, run:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/hello-world  
```

## Deploying with Wrangler

Before deployment, ensure your Cloudflare account is configured and login via:

```bash
wrangler login
```

Then deploy:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run deploy
```

This process will set up your project and upload the function to Cloudflareâ€™s edge network.

If successful, the output should resemble:

```bash
Your worker has access to the following bindings:
- Vars:
  - NODE_ENV: "production"
Uploaded my-app (4.63 sec)
Deployed my-app triggers (3.01 sec)
  https://my-app.<your-cloudflare-zone>.workers.dev
  schedule: * * * * 1
```

To verify the deployment, run:

```bash
curl https://my-app.<your-cloudflare-zone>.workers.dev/hello-world
```

## How Pikku Works with Cloudflare Functions

Pikku requires two key files for Cloudflare integration:

### 1. Setup services

```typescript reference title="setup-services.ts"
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pikkujs/pikku/blob/master/templates/cloudflare-workers/src/setup-services.ts
```

This is a wrapper around the users `createSingletonServices`, but adds the LocalVariablesService to allow access to environment variables.

:::note
We want to make parts of the framework like this visible to the end user so they understand how things work. However, in the future this might move into a library or utility.

### 2. Entry Point

```typescript reference title="index.ts"
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pikkujs/pikku/blob/master/templates/cloudflare-workers/src/index.ts
```

This file acts as the entry point and routes requests to the Pikku runtime.
