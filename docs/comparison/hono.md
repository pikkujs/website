# **Hono vs. Pikku: A Feature Comparison**

## **Introduction**
Choosing the right framework depends on your project’s needs. **Hono** is a **high-performance HTTP framework**, ideal for lightweight and serverless applications. **Pikku**, on the other hand, is an **event-driven backend framework** that supports **multiple transports beyond HTTP**, with **built-in fetch, WebSocket, and Next.js wrappers**, and **automatic schema validation**.

Below is a **side-by-side comparison** to help you decide which one fits your use case.

## **Core Philosophies**

### **Hono: A Lightweight HTTP Framework**
Hono is a **minimalist, high-performance HTTP framework** that excels in edge computing environments. Designed to be **fast and flexible**, it provides just the essentials—routing and middleware—allowing developers to bring in additional libraries as needed.

- ✅ **Blazing-fast HTTP performance**  
- ✅ **Tiny footprint (~12KB) with zero dependencies**  
- ✅ **Designed for Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, and Node.js**  
- ✅ **Optimized for microservices and API gateways**  

### **Pikku: An Event-Driven, Transport-Agnostic Framework**
Pikku takes a **different approach**—it’s an **event-driven framework** that **removes transport concerns from functions**. You define business logic **without worrying about whether it’s an HTTP request, WebSocket event, or queue message**.

- ✅ **Functions as endpoints (transport-agnostic architecture)**  
- ✅ **Supports HTTP, WebSockets, and event queues (coming soon)**  
- ✅ **Batteries-included: auth, permissions, validation, testing**  
- ✅ **Minimal boilerplate with auto-generated API clients & docs**

## **Feature Breakdown**

### **🚀 Performance**
Hono is designed for **ultrafast HTTP routing**, while Pikku is optimized for **multi-transport event handling**.

| Aspect                 | **Hono** 🚀                    | **Pikku** ⚡                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Routing Speed**      | Ultrafast, optimized trie-based router | Fast, but includes built-in validation & services |
| **Cold Start Time**    | Extremely low (less than 1ms on CF Workers) | Slightly higher due to services |
| **Memory Usage**       | Minimal                        | Slightly higher for built-in features |

### **📦 Scaffolding & Project Setup**
Pikku **ships with a full project template**, while Hono provides a **basic starter**.

## **Final Thoughts**
Both Hono and Pikku are excellent frameworks, but they serve **different needs**:

- **Hono** is best for **high-performance APIs, microservices, and edge deployments**.  
- **Pikku** is best for **event-driven applications, multi-transport backends, and full-stack development**.

If **speed and minimalism** are your priority, go with **Hono**. If you need a **powerful, all-in-one backend framework with automatic API clients, schema validation, testing, and documentation**, **Pikku** is the way to go.
