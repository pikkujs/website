## Introduction to Functions in Vramework

Functions in Vramework serve as a core interface for the application. They manage logic, interact with services, and handle data processing. Functions are highly flexible and can:

- Accept arguments
- Return objects
- Interact with services
- Handle errors

## Function-Centric Approach

In Vramework, functions often act as a service layer, interacting with databases or caches. Since they are independent of HTTP, the core logic is typically placed directly within the functions.

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple function that retrieves a book:

```typescript
/**
 * services: The available services
 * data: The input data, in this case, JustBookId
 * returns: A Book object
 * throws: BookNotFoundError
 */
const getBook: APIFunction<JustBookId, Book> = async (services, data) => {
  return await services.database
    .selectFrom('book')
    .selectAll()
    .where('bookId', '=', data.bookId)
    .executeTakeFirstOrThrow();
};
```

## Service-Oriented Approach

The `express-starter` examples use a service-driven approach, similar to frameworks like NestJS. In this case, functions interact directly with services to perform specific actions.

```typescript
/**
 * services: The available services
 * data: The input data, in this case, JustBookId
 * returns: A Book object
 * throws: BookNotFoundError
 */
const getBook: APIFunction<JustBookId, Book> = async (services, data) => {
  return await services.books.getBook(data.id);
};
```

## Error Handling

A more detailed explanation of error handling will be covered later. For now, it's important to note that errors can be structured to map to specific error codes.

## HTTP Access in Functions

To access HTTP-related elements (such as request or response objects), an HTTP service can be created. This service abstracts HTTP details, allowing for:

- Easier testing through stubbing
- Flexibility across different deployment strategies
- Clearer and more manageable API interfaces

## Function Interfaces

Vramework declares function interfaces within its core types to ensure that all `APIFunctions` have the correct typing.

```typescript title="vramework-types"
export type APIFunction<In, Out, RequiredServices = Services> = (services: RequiredServices, data: In, session: UserSession) => Promise<Out>;

export type APIFunctionSessionless<In, Out, RequiredServices = Services> = (services: RequiredServices, data: In, session?: UserSession | undefined) => Promise<Out>;
```

## Conclusion

Functions in Vramework provide a consistent and flexible way to manage services, data, and HTTP requests. The next section will explain how these functions are connected to actual HTTP routes, offering developers a seamless experience.
