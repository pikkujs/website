**Note**: WIP


We are pretty familiar with functions for the overview tutorial. The changes in this are:,

- the main.ts and vramework.config.json file moving up to the `backends/api/` folder

- the url routes are not hardcoded, but are instead imported from the sdk directory

- all the types are also import from within the sdk directoy
