## The Serverless Lock-In Trap

**The Decision:** "Go all-in on [Cloud X] serverless."

**The Wall:**
- Vendor-specific APIs everywhere
- Costs spike unpredictably at scale
- Migration means rewriting everything

**Result:** The financial trap closes. You're stuck with soaring bills or facing a migration project that diverts engineering from business value. Either way, vendor lock-in eliminates your negotiating leverage and control over infrastructure costs.

## The Research Speaks

**It's not just us saying this** — studies, industry data, and even regulators validate the need for architectural flexibility to avoid vendor lock-in and control costs.

**Industry Reality:**
- **78% of organizations** pursue hybrid or multi-cloud strategies specifically to avoid vendor lock-in and reduce costs ([Fortinet 2024](https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/what-is-multi-cloud), [451 Research/S&P Global 2020](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/the-multicloud-security-challenge))
- **2/3 of CIOs** want to avoid cloud vendor lock-in, yet **71% of companies** still end up heavily tied to a single provider using dozens of that provider's services ([Bain & Company 2020](https://www.bain.com/insights/snap-chart-cios-say-they-want-to-avoid-vendor-lock-in/))
- This creates a massive challenge: leaders recognize the risk, but traditional approaches make true portability nearly impossible

### 40% Cost Reduction

> "Hybrid architectures can run at **40% of the cost** of single-cloud setups."

*— [Skedulix, IEEE Cloud 2020](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9284312)*

Multi-cloud scheduling achieves significant cost savings by dynamically selecting optimal execution environments.

### 85% Fewer Violations

> "Mixing VM-based and serverless resources cut SLA violations by **85%** and costs by **53%**."

*— [LIBRA, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1109/IC2E52221.2021.00027)*

Hybrid deployments provide better reliability and cost efficiency than single-architecture approaches.

### Substantial Barriers

> "Vendor lock-in … demands substantial effort to overcome existing barriers."

*— [Opara-Martins et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2016.07.008)*

Technical and economic switching costs create long-term constraints on architectural evolution.

</div>

</div>

Even regulators agree: **egress fees** and **technical barriers** discourage switching. The [UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA, 2025)](https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/cloud-services) highlighted these as major concerns in cloud markets.

## Keep the Cost of Changing Your Mind Near Zero

The real cost of lock-in isn't just money — it's **opportunity cost**. Every day spent rewriting for a new runtime is a day not spent building features or serving customers. Migration projects divert your best engineers from delivering business value. **Pikku prevents this by dramatically reducing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of your infrastructure.**

### Reducing Infrastructure Risk & Controlling Costs

**Pikku lowers TCO through architectural flexibility:**

- **Avoid expensive migrations** — No rewrite projects that divert engineering from business value when you need to change clouds or execution models
- **Control costs as you scale** — Always run on the most cost-efficient infrastructure for each component (start serverless, move to VMs when economics shift)
- **Maintain vendor leverage** — Never get trapped by a single cloud provider raising prices. You can switch without pain.
- **Accelerate time-to-market** — Your team builds features instead of managing infrastructure transitions

### Example: Cost Control as You Scale

**Nearly half of cloud-based businesses struggle to control costs as they scale**, often because switching to cheaper alternatives means costly rewrites. With Pikku, you continually choose the best price-performance option for each workload—no rewrite needed.

**Day 1:** Start serverless on AWS Lambda — $0/month (free tier), instant auto-scaling

**Month 6:** Traffic grows — still on Lambda — $200/month, no ops overhead

**Year 1:** Steady high traffic — switch to dedicated VMs — $80/month, 60% cost reduction

**Year 2:** Hybrid approach — critical paths on VMs, burst handling on Lambda — optimal cost/performance

**Same code. Different economics. Zero rewrites.**

## The Bottom Line

<div style={{backgroundColor: 'var(--ifm-color-emphasis-100)', border: '3px solid var(--ifm-color-primary)', borderRadius: '8px', padding: '2rem', margin: '2rem 0', textAlign: 'center'}}>

### Build once, run anywhere. Keep the cost of changing your mind near zero.

**In a world where requirements change overnight, flexibility is the optimization.**

Pikku ensures you can adapt infrastructure without burning time or money on rewrites. Your architecture becomes a competitive advantage, not a constraint.

</div>

## Strategic Value

**Lower Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):**
- Avoid expensive cloud migrations and maintain leverage with vendors
- No rewrite projects that divert engineering from business value when switching platforms
- Always run on the most economical infrastructure for your scale

**Reduce Infrastructure Risk:**
- Never get locked into one cloud, architecture, or execution model
- Maintain negotiating power with cloud providers
- Adapt to regulatory requirements (on-prem, specific regions) without rewrites

**Accelerate Time-to-Market:**
- Build features instead of managing infrastructure transitions
- Respond to market changes faster than competitors
- Focus engineering effort on competitive advantages, not platform migrations
