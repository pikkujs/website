# Why Pikku?

**Write backend logic once. Run it everywhere. Keep the cost of changing your mind near zero.**

Pikku solves the fundamental problems that slow teams down: vendor lock-in, protocol duplication, and infrastructure lock-in. Whether you're building a new product or scaling an existing one, Pikku gives you the flexibility to adapt without rewrites.

## Architectural Flexibility

**Same code, any runtime. Deploy anywhere without rewrites.**

- Start with a monolith, scale to microservices—no code changes
- Switch from serverless to VMs to containers—just config
- Mix deployment strategies: HTTP on Lambda, WebSockets on a server
- Adapt to new platforms as they emerge

Traditional frameworks lock you into one architecture. Pikku adapts to your needs at any stage.

## AI-Era Quality

**Simple, consistent patterns mean dramatically better AI-generated code.**

- Claude, GPT, and other AI tools understand Pikku's patterns
- Generate new functions with confidence
- Expose functions to AI agents via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Build CLI tools and automation from your existing backend logic

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a cornerstone of the next internet, and Pikku's MCP integration bridges the gap—allowing your normal APIs to work with AI agents without any cognitive overhead.
