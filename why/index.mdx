# Why Pikku?

**Write backend logic once. Run it everywhere. Keep the cost of changing your mind near zero.**

Pikku solves the fundamental problems that slow teams down: vendor lock-in, protocol duplication, and infrastructure lock-in. Whether you're building a new product or scaling an existing one, Pikku gives you the flexibility to adapt without rewrites.

## 🏗️ Architectural Flexibility

**Same code, any runtime. Deploy anywhere without rewrites.**

- Start with a monolith, scale to microservices—no code changes
- Switch from serverless to VMs to containers—just config
- Mix deployment strategies: HTTP on Lambda, WebSockets on a server
- Adapt to new platforms as they emerge

Traditional frameworks lock you into one architecture. Pikku adapts to your needs at any stage.

## 💰 Cost Optimization

**Control infrastructure costs. Never get trapped by vendor pricing.**

- Deploy to the most cost-effective platform for each workload
- Switch providers when pricing changes—no vendor leverage over you
- Avoid costly migration projects that divert engineering from business value
- 40% cost reduction with hybrid architectures (research-backed)

Pikku reduces Total Cost of Ownership by eliminating rewrite costs and maintaining vendor negotiating power.

## 🤖 AI-Era Quality

**Simple, consistent patterns mean dramatically better AI-generated code.**

- Claude, GPT, and other AI tools understand Pikku's patterns
- Generate new functions with confidence
- Expose functions to AI agents via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Build CLI tools and automation from your existing backend logic

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a cornerstone of the next internet, and Pikku's MCP integration bridges the gap—allowing your normal APIs to work with AI agents without any cognitive overhead.

## 📝 TypeScript Everywhere

**End-to-end type safety across all protocols and runtimes.**

- Write TypeScript functions with full type inference
- Auto-generated type-safe clients for HTTP, WebSockets, and RPC
- Catch errors at compile time, not in production
- IntelliSense support across your entire stack

Pikku brings complete type safety to every layer of your backend—across all protocols and runtimes.

## 🔌 Protocol Unification

**One function. Every protocol. Zero duplication.**

- HTTP APIs, WebSockets, queues, cron jobs, CLI, MCP—from one codebase
- Same auth, permissions, and validation across all protocols
- Progressive enhancement: Add SSE to HTTP without breaking clients
- Expose backend logic to AI agents via Model Context Protocol

Stop maintaining separate implementations for each protocol. Write once, wire anywhere.

## Key Advantages

### 🚀 Ship Faster, Maintain Less

Write business logic once and deliver features across all protocols instantly. One source of truth means:

- **Fewer bugs** — No sync issues between HTTP and WebSocket implementations
- **Faster iterations** — Change logic once, updates everywhere
- **Easier testing** — Test functions directly without mocking protocol layers

### 🔐 Production-Ready Features

Built-in support for everything production apps need:

- **Authentication & Authorization** — Cookie, bearer, API key auth with fine-grained permissions
- **Services** — Singleton and per-request dependency injection (database, logger, config)
- **Middleware** — Before/after hooks that work across all protocols
- **Schema Validation** — Auto-validate against TypeScript schemas at runtime
- **OpenAPI Generation** — Auto-generated API documentation from your functions

### 🪶 Zero Lock-In

Pikku doesn't lock you in—it frees you from lock-in:

- **Standard TypeScript** — No magic, no proprietary APIs
- **Bring your own tools** — Any database, any logger, any framework
- **Tiny runtime** — Minimal overhead, bundles as small as 50KB
- **Easy migration** — If you ever need to leave, it's just TypeScript functions
