### How can I try it out?

I set up an [example repo](https://github.com/vramework/vramework-example) which will hopefully be updated in the upcoming weeks with a fully working example.

### Where are the tests at?

Great question. Since vramework is a pretty lightweight wrapper around express and serverless the tests we do are mostly in the proprietary layer, mostly done via E2E frameworks. It's not in the best interest of an OS project, but open-sourcing this, in general, was more to share
a solution I came up with rather than have heavy marketing or promotions. Hopefully, if it makes sense these things will be added by other
core maintainers, hence the MIT license.

### What's the risk of being hooked in?

None. If you decide you want to just go with express u can just go back to using express and their middleware. You don't have to use one or the other.
