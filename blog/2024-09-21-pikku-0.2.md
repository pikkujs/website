## What Is Pikku?

Pikku is a lightweight abstraction layer between HTTP requests and your code. It allows you to focus on the core logic without worrying about the underlying HTTP mechanics. Simply put, it's all about data in, data out, and error handling—nothing more.

**Request Handling Workflow:**

1. **Route Validation**:  
   *Does the route exist?*  
   **No?** Return **404 Not Found**.

2. **Data Validation**:  
   *Is the input data valid?*  
   **No?** Return **400 Bad Request**.

3. **Session Management**:  
   *Is a session required and present?*  
   **No?** Return **401 Unauthorized**.

4. **Permission Checks**:  
   *Does the user have the necessary permissions?*  
   **No?** Return **403 Forbidden**.

5. **Method Execution**:  
   *Did the method execute successfully?*  
   **No?** Map the error to the appropriate HTTP status code.

6. **Response Delivery**:  
   Send the response back to the client.

**Example Code:**

```typescript
import { route, pikkuFunc } from '../pikku-types';

export const createTodo = pikkuFunc<CreateTodo, JustTodoId>(async (
  services, data, session
) => {
  return await services.kysely
    .insertInto('app.todo')
    .values({
      ...data,
      createdBy: session.userId,
    })
    .returning('todoId')
    .executeTakeFirstOrThrow();
});

export const routes = [
  route({
    method: 'post',
    route: '/todo',
    schema: 'CreateTodo',
    func: createTodo,
    permissions: {
      isUser,
    },
  }),
];
```

With pikku, you can effortlessly integrate with servers like Express, Fastify, or uWS, and even invoke functions directly within frameworks like Next.js or NestJS.

## Why Choose Pikku Over NestJS, tRPC, or Encore?

### **Less Magic, More Control**

Pikku avoids the "magic" often found in other frameworks, where hidden processes can make debugging challenging. By providing explicit and transparent code structures, you gain full control over your application's behavior.

### **Lightweight and Open Source**

Written entirely in TypeScript and open-sourced under the MIT license, pikku is minimalistic yet powerful. Its lean codebase makes it accessible for debugging and community contributions.

### **Infrastructure Agnostic**

Unlike frameworks that lock you into specific infrastructure providers, pikku is flexible. You can choose any services or databases you prefer, whether it's AWS, Google Cloud, Backblaze, or a database of your choice.

### **Plain TypeScript Usage**

Embrace the simplicity of plain TypeScript. Define services as regular classes and functions that receive services, data, and user sessions—no decorators or special syntax required.

### **Flexible Deployment**

Deploy pikku in a way that suits you:

- Integrate with Express, Fastify, or uWS.
- Use it directly within Next.js.
- Plan for future support of gRPC and WebSocket protocols based on community interest.
