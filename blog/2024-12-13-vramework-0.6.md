# Announcing Vramework 0.6: WebSockets, Scheduled Tasks, and a More Flexible, Typed Future

Modern backend development can be messy. You might lock into a single runtime or server, and keeping frontend and backend types in sync is often painful. **[Vramework](https://github.com/vramework/vramework)** 0.6 aims to change that—offering a function-first, TypeScript-powered ecosystem that lets you build once and deploy anywhere with complete type safety.

<!-- truncate -->

Vramework isn’t just another Node.js server framework. Instead, it’s a lightweight abstraction layer that pairs seamlessly with servers like [uWebSockets.js (uWS)](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/). It runs on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and will soon support [Bun](https://bun.sh/) or [Deno](https://deno.land/). Whether you deploy to Docker containers on VMs or use a serverless platform like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions), Vramework’s abstractions help you switch infrastructure without massive rewrites.

## What’s New in Vramework 0.6

### Scheduled Tasks

You can now define scheduled tasks right alongside your API functions—no separate cron setup or external schedulers needed. These tasks can run in both traditional servers and serverless runtimes. For example, deploy them on AWS Lambda with EventBridge or Azure Functions Timer Triggers. Just one function and a simple configuration:

```typescript
import { addScheduledTask } from '@vramework/core/scheduler'

export const myScheduledTask: APIFunctionSessionless<void, void> = async (services) => {
    // Your scheduled logic here
}

addScheduledTask({
    name: 'myScheduledTask',
    schedule: '*/1 * * * *', // every minute
    func: myScheduledTask,
})
```

This makes recurring jobs (like daily data syncs or periodic cleanups) straightforward and fully integrated—no matter where you run them.

---

### Channels (WebSockets and Beyond)

Real-time capabilities are now first-class citizens in Vramework. We’re introducing **Channels**, a unified interface for bi-directional communication. Inspired by [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/) and influenced by tools like [deepstream.io](https://deepstream.io/), Channels let you:

- Manage WebSocket connections with type safety, session handling, and authentication.
- Implement pub/sub patterns seamlessly with built-in subscription services.
- Deploy to VMs, Docker containers, or serverless WebSocket environments without painful rewrites.

---

**Example Channel Functions:**

```typescript
export const onConnect: ChannelConnection<'hello!'> = async (services, channel) => {
    services.logger.info('New connection')
    channel.send('hello!')
}

export const authenticate: ChannelMessage<{ token: string }, { authResult: boolean }> = async (services, channel, data) => {
    const authResult = data.token === 'valid'
    if (authResult) channel.setSession({ userId: 'Bob' })
    channel.send({ authResult })
}
```

---

**Linking Functions into a Channel:**

```typescript
import { addChannel } from '@vramework/core/channel'
import { onConnect, onMessage, onDisconnect, subscribe, unsubscribe, emitMessage, authenticate } from './events.functions.js'

addChannel({
    channel: '/event',
    // Called when a client connects to the channel
    onConnect,
    // Called when a client disconnects from the channel
    onDisconnect,
    // A global auth guard for all message routes (can be overridden)
    auth: true,
    // Default message handler if no route is matched
    onMessage,
    onMessageRoute: {
        action: {
            // Sets the user session, enabling authenticated routes
            auth: {
                func: authenticate,
                auth: false,
            },
            // A route with nested function config for applying permissions
            subscribe: {
                func: subscribe,
                permissions: {},
            },
            // Shorthand route definition
            unsubscribe,
            // A route that references another function
            emit: emitMessage
        }
    }
})
```

This approach keeps your real-time code organized and modular. Switch between servers or move to a serverless WebSocket platform without touching your message-handling logic—just plug in the right adapter.

### Stronger Compile-Time Insights

Vramework’s CLI extracts type information at compile time. This approach lets you:

- Automatically generate [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) documentation from your TypeScript definitions.
- Create typed clients that can be shared with frontends, ensuring zero-maintenance API contracts.
- Reduce runtime overhead and catch schema errors before hitting production.

For example, define your inputs and outputs inline:

```typescript
const updateBirthday: APIFunction<{ userId: string; birthday: number }, { success: boolean }> = async (services) => {
  // Implementation
}
```

Vramework will automatically generate `UpdateBirthdayInput` and `UpdateBirthdayOutput` types—no decorators or repetitive schema definitions required.

---

## Dropping the Dead Weight

To move faster and focus on what matters, we’ve made some clean breaks:

- **CommonJS Support:** Removed in favor of ESM.
- **Next.js Pages:** Temporarily dropped to maintain a cleaner separation of concerns.
- **Embedded Inline Functions:** Streamlined out for now to simplify the code-generation process.

By shedding these complexities, Vramework stays lean, modern, and more maintainable going forward.

## A Greener Future: Measuring Impact and Carbon Offsets

As infrastructure choices multiply, understanding their environmental impact becomes more important. Vramework’s flexibility makes it easier to experiment with different runtimes, servers, and deployment options—be it on VMs, containers, or serverless. By observing how these choices affect **CPU cycles and memory consumption**, you can get a clearer picture of the carbon footprint associated with your application’s workload.

We’re excited about the idea of using Vramework as a platform to help companies make environmentally informed decisions. Imagine comparing resource usage and emissions across deployments and automatically suggesting lower-impact configurations. While this is still in the concept stage, it’s a direction we’re exploring to align performance optimization with environmental responsibility.
