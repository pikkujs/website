# Pikku has just gone serverless ðŸš€

_Just in time for Christmas!_

I know, the day before Christmas isnâ€™t exactly the best day for announcements, but Iâ€™m about to put away my keyboard until next year and wanted one final blog entry before taking a break. And Iâ€™m excited to share that Pikku now has **official support** for serverless on AWS and Cloudflare â€” complete with examples!

This milestone has been really interesting. Different serverless solutions definitely donâ€™t think alike, especially when it comes to websockets. My main goal was to prove Pikku can handle websockets (along with HTTP and scheduled tasks, which were a breeze) and do it all in a way that you can get up and running as quickly as possible.

After a few days of headbanging, we ended up with three new backends in the [workspace-starter](https://github.com/pikku/workspace-starter) repo, each offering a different serverless approach:

---

## 1. Serverless (AWS Lambda)

This is the classic [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) setup using a `yaml` file to deploy Lambda functions in AWS. If you want your scheduled tasks and HTTP APIs running in no time, this oneâ€™s a solid pick. Just grab the template, follow the instructions, and youâ€™re good to go.

## 2. Serverless Websocket (AWS)

This is also powered by Serverless but kept separate since websockets arenâ€™t everyoneâ€™s cup of tea. For those who do need websockets, this example includes a PostgreSQL subscription and channel store. (Normally, AWS suggests DynamoDB, but since we're already on PostgreSQL, why not stick with it?) Iâ€™ll share more documentation on these stores in the next release.

## 3. Cloudflare Workers

Last but definitely not least: **Cloudflare Workers**. This lets us deploy HTTP, scheduled tasks, and websocket connections via Cloudflareâ€”a more cost-efficient solution than AWS in many cases. They offer something called a [Websocket server with Hibernation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/examples/websocket-hibernation-server/), which cuts down on costs by suspending the server when there are no connections. Combine that with [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/examples/durable-object-in-memory-state/), and thereâ€™s no need for an external database like on AWS.

Iâ€™ve only tested this in Wrangler (the offline Cloudflare runner), so itâ€™s still in beta. Depending on feedback, we can also create adapters for other websocket solutions Cloudflare provides.

## Wrapping Up

Thatâ€™s it for now! There are some other improvements (and a few breaking changes) coming soon, but they can wait until next year. 

Have a wonderful holiday season, and see you all in the new year!
