Hello again!

I'm excited to announce that our rebrand is officially here â€“ welcome to Pikku! This isnâ€™t just a facelift; itâ€™s a complete rethink of how we can make developers' lives easier. Inspired by awesome projects like [Hono](https://hono.dev) and fueled by genuine feedback from our NodeJS meetup, we've revamped most things to be more streamlined.

I'm still sharpening my branding skills, but with the help of friends and a touch of MIT-inspired magic, we now have a look and feel that's as simple as the code we write.

## Whatâ€™s New?

### ðŸ“Š In-Depth Explanations and Flow Diagrams

We tried to share as much information as we could without overloading the user. Mermaid diagrams and in-depth explanations are now located in multiple documents!

### ðŸš€ Create with a Single Command

Kickstart your projects faster than ever:

```bash
npm run pikku@latest
```
This one command sets up templates, including a Next.js app and a fully-fledged yarn workspace that's backed by a Postgres database, and even lays out deployment options (Docker files included). 

### ðŸ”— All-In-One: The Pikku npm Package

Streamline your imports with a single, centralized package:

```typescript
import { ... } from 'pikku'
```
No more juggling a dozen individual packagesâ€”just one sleek entry point to supercharge your development workflow.

:::note
This is a change that will roll out as we ensure that package sizes don't grow.

### ðŸ›  New @pikku/schema-cfworker Package

Introducing our versatile schema validator! It might be a bit slower since it skips precompilation, but itâ€™s designed to work seamlessly across all deployment platforms.

### ðŸ’¡ Enhanced APIs & CI Improvements

- **APIs:** Our Next.js integrations and PikkuFetch now provide cleaner, more intuitive interfaces. Random TypeScript errors? Consider them history.
- **CI Enhancements:** Every template now undergoes rigorous testing as part of our improved CI pipeline, ensuring that every build is solid from the get-go.

Iâ€™m excited for you to try out Pikku and see these improvements in action. Dive in, explore, and hit me with your feedbackâ€”this rebrand is just the start of a long journey, and I'm all in for making things better and faster.
