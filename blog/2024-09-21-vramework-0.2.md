title: Vramework 0.2
description: Launching vramework 0.2!
---

Hey! Super excited to announce the launch of vramework 0.2!

Vramework has been around for the last few years, although the inclusion strategy was mostly to include it as a submodule for bespoke projects.

Version 0.2 fully changes that and provides a fully working set of libraries in order to make it a much more seamless experience.

These changes include:

- documentation, documentation and more documentation
- adding a small CLI tool for schema and routes generation
- adding a vramework.config.json file to drive state
- tests
- a common runRoutes method that allows vramework to be called via any framework
- a request/response wrapper to allow vramework to work with most Node.js HTTP libraries
- some TypeScript tweaking
- Next.js integration
- an [example workspace](https://github.com/vramework/workspace-starter) with everything in place

# So, what is vramework exactly?

Vramework is a thin abstraction layer between HTTP calls and your code. The important part really is that you *ideally* don't need to care about HTTP as much. Data in, data out, possibly a normal error gets thrown. That's pretty much the gist of a function.

The exact sequence is:
- does the route exist?
  *No? Not Found*
- is the data valid?
  *No? Invalid Data*
- do you need and have a session?
  *No? Access Denied*
- are you permissioned?
  *No? Access Denied*
- Did you successfully run the method?
  *No? Map error to HTTP code and message*
- Send response (if available) to user

```typescript
import { route, type APIRoutes, APIFunction } from '../vramework-types'

export const createTodo: APIFunction<CreateTodo, JustTodoId> = async (
  services, data, session
) => {
  return await services.kysely
    .insertInto('app.todo')
    .values({
      ...data,
      createdBy: session.userId,
    })
    .returning('todoId')
    .executeTakeFirstOrThrow()
}

export const routes = [
  route({
    method: 'post',
    route: '/todo',
    schema: 'CreateTodo',
    func: createTodo,
    permissions: {
      isUser
    }
  })
]
```

# Isn't this pretty similar to Encore?

Funnily enough, right before writing this I came across [encore](https://encore.dev/), and I was like, okay, this is clearly very cool.

```typescript
import { api } from "encore.dev/api";
 
// Wrap regular functions with { api } to expose them as API endpoints
export const ping = api(
  { method: "GET", path: "/hello/:name", expose: true }, // API options
  async (params: { name: string }): Promise<{ message: string }> => {
    return {message: `Hello, ${params.name}`};
  });
```

Plus it deploys things straight away! And uses a Rust engine! 

# So, why vramework (compared to NestJS, tRPC, Encore)?

A few reasons come to mind:

## Less magic

Vramework is built without much magic in place. By magic I mean patterns like in Next.js where you import headers via `import headers from 'next/headers'` and because it's event-driven you know it's probably your request's headers, but it still feels a bit eerie referring to a global that way.

Or importing a database service that somehow initializes on import, so the lifetime is out of your control.

Now don't get me wrong, magic can be awesome. But it also requires quite a bit of understanding and documentation digging occasionally which can drive one a bit insane.

That being said, you'll likely see things as magical in vramework. But hopefully a lot more obvious.

## Vramework is a tiny amount of code

Not the strongest argument, but less code is usually fun. It's also fully open-source under MIT and written in TypeScript so hopefully more accessible to the end user.

## Plain ol' TypeScript

Plain TypeScript ftw. Want a service? It's a normal TypeScript class. Want a function? Receives the services, data and a user session. No decorators, other classes and imports or special syntax required.

There are a few APIs needed to glue things together, but even those are mostly just normal functions.

## Deployment

Use it directly within Express, Fastify, uWS or directly from Next.js. 

# Still a WIP

I have used vramework in multiple production environments previously, but the changes for 0.2 haven't yet been fully tested. The main goal of this release is to see if this is something people are curious to use!

# Shameless plug

I'm also currently contracting in the UK and have a strong background in Node.js, React, Terraform, AWS, real-time tech, CI and the general JS ecosystem. If you have a project you think I could help out with, feel free to contact me at yasser.fadl@vlandor.com.
